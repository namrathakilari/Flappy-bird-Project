# Flappy-bird-Project
Flappy Bird is a simple, fast-paced arcade game where players control a small bird attempting to fly through endless sets of pipes without crashing. As the game progresses, the speed and difficulty gradually increase, testing the player’s timing and reflexes.
# 🐤 Flappy Bird - JavaScript Edition
